                <h1>Who is Samurai?</h1>

                <p>Samurai is a fictional legendary chromatic rock band featured throughout the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberpunk_series">Cyberpunk series</a>, though most predominantly in the video game <a href="#Cyberpunk2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, for whom music was a way to rebel against the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Corporation">corporations</a>. Based in <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Night_City">Night City</a> in the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/New_United_States">N.U.S.A</a>, the band was co-founded in 2003 (though it is not entirely clear if this is accurate) by <a href="#JS">Johnny Silverhand</a> and <a href="#KE">Kerry Eurodyne</a>, though the group's name was coined by <a href="#NH">Nancy Hartley</a>. The name, Samurai, was inspired by the fact that historical samurai were willing to die for their cause, even if it was immoral or just plain wrong. Nancy thought that kind of blind loyalty was very stupid, and so she decided to take the name and turn it around into a “street” meaning as a form of mockery. Johnny and Kerry simply thought it sounded cool. There's little information about when or how, but the two other members of the band were Denny and Henry (no last names to be found).</p>

                <p>Samurai started out as a back-street band, playing in various clubs and bars around Night City. One night in 2003, the band was approached by Jack Masters, the head executive at Universal Music at the time. Within three weeks, Samurai was signed, had a record in production, and was preparing to tour every major city in the world. Within these three weeks, their first single, “Blistering Love”, hit #1 on the EuroCharts, which was soon followed up with the album, being one of the few times a debut album achieved such status in such a short time. During the next years, Samurai toured around the world, playing concerts with an audience of thousands of people, even managing to sell out the whole Wembley stadium.</p>

                <p>In 2007, the band suffered a blow that would later be decisive, where Nancy was sentenced to seven months of prison, during which the band firmly supported her. More detail on that <a href="#NH">here</a>. In 2008, Nancy finally got out of jail, focused on returning with the rest of Samurai. However, those seven months of inactivity had put a split in the band that they were unable to heal as each band member was going in different creative directions. They all went their separate ways shortly thereafter. More on this is the <a href="#Members">members</a> section below. Johnny and Kerry did however go on to have successful solo careers, usually touring together as a double ticket.</p>

                <p>In 2023, Johnny was recording a new song in one of his studios, which would eventually be credited under the name Samurai, titled "<a href="#Songs">Black Dog</a>", but he never got to release it as most of its recordings were lost in the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Night_City_Holocaust">Arasaka Headquarters Bombing</a>; a nuclear disaster which Johnny took part in, which resulted in him being killed and his soul being transferred onto an engram. More about this <a href="#JS">here</a>. This unreleased song was later discovered by a group of people, one of which was a <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Rocker">rockerboy</a> named Lilayah, who was looking for the song after having found a partial record. This eventually led them to get the original studio version, which was later released to the public.</p>

                <p>In 2077, most of the original band got together to play a last gig in the Red Dirt bar—which was where they had their first ever gig—including Johnny. Though Johnny was there in the form of an engram in the head of a person called <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/V_(character)">V</a>, a Night City mercenary and the main protagonist of Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

                <h2>Johnny Silverhand - voiced by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000206/">Keanu Reeves</a></h2>

                <p>As a teenager, Johnny—still going by his birth name then: Robert John Linder—enlisted in the military after lying about his real age, and it didn't take long for him to see action. He was sent to Nicaragua to participate in the  <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Central_American_War">Second American War</a> of 2003. While in the war, John's life was purportedly saved by a friend who died protecting him, though he did still lose his left arm. Perpetrated by a corrupt and manipulative US Government, the conflict was devastating. When the government's secrets were exposed, many of the American soldiers dropped their banners and fought back by deserting the military. In response, however, the government used its influence to launch a powerful propaganda campaign against these former soldiers and convinced the American public to despise them as deserters. John was one of those soldiers. He left for Night City, where he stayed for a whole month after his arrival at a hotel, practically rotting away.</p>

                <p>Not one to stay down, however, John changed his name to Johnny Silverhand, with his new surname referencing the bionic arm he had implanted to replace his left arm. Johnny thus began his mission of rebellion and exposing corruption by starting Samurai with Kerry. After Samurai's eventual disbandment, Johnny was still one of the most popular musicians at the time, who defined the rockerboy movement as it is known today, and he planned to use his star power to launch a solo career with which to continue pushing his anti-corporation and anti-government message. By then, DBS Music wanted to sign Johnny so desperately that they blackmailed him, threatening to reveal his true identity as a deserter of the Second Central American Conflict. In defiance of DBS Music's attempts to blackmail him, Johnny instead signed once again with Universal Music. He released a complete album entitled “SINS of Your Brothers,” in which he admitted to being a deserter and revealed all the terrible actions the government had ordered its military to carry out. The album was wildly successful and changed public perception on what it meant to be a deserter.</p>

                <p>Johnny continued his rebellious campaign into the 2010's. During this time, he performed his famous free benefit concert to call attention to the brutal methods the NCPD used to quell the Homeless Riots. Johnny's relationship with <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Rogue_Amendiares">Rouge Amendiares</a> also ended at some point in 2011 after she discovered that he had cheated on her.</p>

                <p>After giving a concert on August 4th in 2013, Johnny re-connected with his former girlfriend, <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Altiera_Cunningham">Alt Cunningham</a>. When the two went for a walk together that night, they were ambushed by a group of thugs hired by <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Arasaka">Arasaka</a> - one of the most influential megacorporations in the Cyberpunk universe. The thugs injured Johnny severely and kidnapped Alt. On the 5th of August, Johnny gathered a strike team consisting of his ex-girlfriend, Rouge, media reporter <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Lyle_Thompson">Lyle Thompson</a>, and the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Nomad">nomad</a> leader of the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Aldecaldos">Aldecaldos</a>, <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Nomad_Santiago">Santiago</a>, in order to infiltrate <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Arasaka_Towers">Arasaka Towers</a> in Night City to save Alt. As a diversion, he called in a favor from all the members of Samurai, who gathered together to perform an entirely free show in front of the complex. Samurai's performance led to a riot at the tower as troops were called in to control the situation. Unbeknownst to Johnny at this time, Arasaka had kidnapped Alt specifically to force her to develop a new version of the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Soulkiller">Soulkiller</a> software she had written in the past. In a panic reaction to the assault, an executive member at Arasaka used the Soulkiller on Alt while the assault took place, trapping her soul inside the Arasaka mainframe. Upon infiltrating the tower, Johnny and the team discovered Alt's lifeless body, oblivious that her soul was trapped in the mainframe, and assumed her dead. After the assault, Johnny and Santiago left Night City and went into hiding with the Aldecaldos, not returning until 2015.</p>

                <p>On <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/The_Fall_of_the_Towers"></a>August 20th, 2023</a>, Johnny and <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Morgan_Blackhand">Morgan Blackhand</a>, alongside Rogue, <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Shaitan">Shaitan</a>, Thompson, and <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Spider_Murphy">Spider Murphy</a>, led a <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Militech">Militech</a> assault team on the Arasaka Towers in Night City, with the intention of destroying the towers with a mini nuke and ultimately ending the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Fourth_Corporate_War">Fourth Corporate War</a>. Johnny had another reason for going back to the towers, however: he wanted to find Alt. After successfully liberating Alt, Johnny's team was pinned down in the Soulkiller labs by Arasaka forces and <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Adam_Smasher">Adam Smasher</a>. Johnny, who had barely managed to find cover, was conflicted on what to do next. He felt that during his first attack on the towers, he had failed Alt, and he was determined this time not to fail her again. With a Militech SMG in one hand and his <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Malorian_Arms_3516">Malorian Arms</a> in the other, Johnny resolved to leave cover, shouting at and provoking Smasher while emptying his ammo into the borg. Smasher, surprised at Silverhand's audacity, whipped around and fired his auto-shotgun at Silverhand, ripping the rockerboy in half. This allowed Shaitan to immobilize the Arasaka borg, granting the rest of the team the chance to escape. Spider Murphy tried to reach Johnny, but she was stopped by Rogue, who told her he was gone. Spider instead reached inside her jacket to pull out a data slug Alt had given to her long ago, and as she whispered to Johnny that she was sorry, she inserted the chip into the back of the dying rockerboy's skull.</p>

                <p>Johnny's engram as coded on the Relic in Cyberpunk 2077 holds a different tale of the events. In Johnny's version of the story, he escaped the initial fight with Smasher and attempted to reach the helicopter where Rogue was waiting, but was again cut off by Smasher. Johnny was then presumed gunned down by the borg and dead, but was instead recovered and detained by Arasaka. According to the engram, while in the custody of Arasaka, Johnny was interrogated first by the corp's security and then later by the head of the Arasaka corporation: <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Saburo_Arasaka">Saburo Arasaka</a> himself. He was subjected to the Soulkiller program, in which his consciousness was scanned and stored on an engram as his physical body died. He was then allegedly buried under concrete in the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Northern_Oilfields">derelict oil fields</a> just outside of Night City.</p>

                <p>Despite there being no body to inter, a niche was dedicated to Johnny's memory at the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/North_Oak_Columbarium">North Oak Columbarium</a>. His epitaph, which uses his real name, reads: "Robert John Linder: Son of a bitch who never gave up. A legend among legends.”</p>

                <p>Half a century later, in 2077, the relic containing Johnny's engram was in the possession of <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Yorinobu_Arasaka">Yorinobu Arasaka</a>, who had stolen the relic in an attempt to bait his father, Saburo Arasaka, out into the public. Enter V and <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Jackie_Welles">Jackie Welles</a>, two up-and-coming mercenaries looking to become legends in Night City. Through means which I won't be going into, play the game if you want to know, the relic, and Johnny with it, ended up in V's head. And after much time spent together like that, Johnny asks V to help him meet up with his old friends, as a way of making up for his past mistakes.</p>

                <h2>Kerry Eurodyne - voiced by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0455058/">Matthew Yang King</a></h2>

                <p>Kerry went into Samurai with a vision of changing the world through his music, one he shared with his best friend, Johnny, but their perspectives regarding the execution of this plan often came to conflict. This led to Kerry's multiple attempts at leaving the band, which were often nearly successful at launching his own solo career, but, eventually, the complex relationship he had with Johnny always pulled him back.</p>

                <p>In the end, Samurai's final disbandment followed Johnny's departure instead, which led Kerry into a rocky few years. He ended up going back to his roots, staying on Masbate in the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/New_Philippines">New Philippines</a> for two years, healing his mind and soul. Kerry did luckily manage to recollect the pieces of himself and came back to the music scene renewed and inspired, if not even encouraged by the idea of elevating his own name out of the shadow Johnny left behind. The new beginning was rough, but through a lot of hard work and effort, his music managed to shine brighter even than fellow artists who'd been in the scene longer than him. He withstood the test of time, his albums have gone platinum, his broken guitars auctioned for thousands of <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Eurodollar">Eurodollars</a>, and his voice and name recognized worldwide.</p>

                <p>Midway through the century, Kerry's life had taken an unexpected turn, leaving him married to Louise Nordin Eurodyne with two children, Ted and Kim. The marriage ended on a low note however, resulting in Louise getting most of their shared possessions; a house in <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, cars and children. Despite trying to stay in positive relations, Kerry's attempts at keeping in touch usually ended up being misguided, and Louise had no trouble using it as a manner of preventing their children from idolizing him. Life without a family, however, if Kerry's own words regarding the matter are to be trusted, seemed to have benefited him, allowing a bit more freedom for that rockerboy lifestyle he managed to make a brand off.</p>

                <p>In 2077, Kerry can be found spending most days in his own villa in <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/North_Oak_(2077)">North Oak</a>, maintaining a successful career as a solo artist. His label, <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/MSM_Records">MSM Mediacorp</a>, had already announced a new album in the works, and the audience that is more accustomed to mass-produced reduplications had started growing impatient. As someone who gives great importance to his public image, Kerry is deeply influenced by peer reviews. Staying concurrent and able to write music that will agree with the times while simultaneously not conforming and retaining originality is not easy for any artist, especially one who's been in the public eye for half a century. While the topics Kerry addresses with his music, mainly the suffering of the people under the heavy foot of corporate capitalism, have never truly gone stale and could provide yet another source of profit and affirmation, the sincerity of the thoughts put into the songs had started waning.</p>

                <p>Without inspiration, without a change to look forward to, and without any real friends to speak of, Kerry slowly started falling back to the state he once was in, the overshadowing 2020's.The feeling of loss was mirrored in his social deprivation, reduction of individuality, depletion of creative inspiration and overall exhaustion of will, which led his mind back to the source of negativity - the loss of a friend. A friend who cast a shadow so long that, even in his brightest moments, Kerry could still feel dousing his flame, regardless of decades passed and media scorn grinding the name “Johnny Silverhand” to not more than a footnote in the city's history.</p>

                <p>Notably yet, the recent hot topic of Night City scream sheets had been the rumor of Kerry attempting to end his own life, though he was fortunately prevented by a bodyguard who managed to take his gun away in time. Through means too long to describe here, V, with Johnny's engram in his head, manages to help Kerry out of his stupor and put together Kerry's idea of having a Samurai reunion, just for one night. The gig revitalizes Kerry, and he admits to V that even half a century later, he had found himself consciously living in Johnny's shadow. But he's rediscovered himself, ready to take on the world anew and prove to himself and everyone that he still has what it takes.</p>

                <h2>Nancy Hartley - voiced by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1017942/">Kosha Egler</a></h2>

                <p>In 2007, Nancy was dating a man whom she eventually married. The rest of Samurai didn't see it at first, but ten weeks after the wedding, they realized Nancy's husband was mistreating her. One day, she finally got the courage to talk about it with the other band members after her husband tried to force her to quit Samurai. That same day, Johnny and Kerry went to Nancy's apartment to beat her husband up, but by the time they got there it was already too late. Nancy's husband had started to beat her again, and she, deciding she'd had enough, threw him out of the window from their 83rd story apartment. She was arrested, and after the trial was sentenced to seven months in prison.</p>

                <p>At some point after her release, and Samurai's breakup, Nancy took on the name Bes Isis and became a major media presence on <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Network_News_54">Network 54</a> due to her persistent pursuit of stories nobody else dared to cover. Sometime in 2011, Bes Isis was in Mexico City, working on a story about the American nomad underground in the region, specifically about the 1990s band Justifiable Homicide. While having a drink in a local bar with the band, a 16-year-old soldier came to her, giving a story about 600,000 nomad workers marooned in South America, trying to get out by walking 3000 miles, in an event known as "The Long Walk". Bes Isis documented the story and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for it. Later, she participated in The Long Walk itself.</p>

                <p>By 2045, Isis continued to run a show on the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Data_Pool">Data Pool</a>, having a mixed reputation compared to other Medias due to her rule-breaking investigations, as well as having replaced her leg and chest with chrome replacements to feign injury to obtain a "meat jumping" story. In 2077, she remained a Network 54 employee, proceeding to cover difficult events as an investigative journalist. She also had an adult son named Dan. Bes briefly went missing while investigating <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Maelstrom">Maelstrom</a> at the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Totentanz_(Watson)">Totentanz</a> club. The mercenary V finds and helps her out after being sent by Kerry to pick her up to organize the Samurai reunion gig.</p>

She and Henry also had a relationship at some point after the band's breakup, though there isn't quite enough information on when. Before 2077, Denny helped get Henry out of a tough situation, and managed to get him a good gig and a decent band to work with. But despite her helping him, Henry kicked Denny out of his life as soon as he no longer needed her. A month later, Henry came back begging Denny for help, but she left him and made sure he could never find her again. In 2077, Denny moved to North Oak, having done rather well for herself.</p>

                <h2>Henry - voiced by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5694706/">Graham Vick</a></h2>

                <p>After Samurai broke up, Henry went on to work on a human interface prototype with a company called Blazetech, which unfortunately fried his brain, but luckily did not kill him. After the incident, Henry's nervous system was rewired and he slowly regained his memory, by 2013 he was slowly regaining basic motor skills. At some point before 2077, Henry became a drug addict. He went to Denny for help, who managed to get him a good gig and a decent band to work with. After a month with the new band, he was kicked out for acting up again, which led to him going back to Denny to beg for help, which she rather understandably did not. This led to Henry almost dying on the street, and Denny simply stepping over him. Henry resents Denny for this, but Denny only ignored him because she thought he was faking it like he had many times before. Afterwards, all of Denny's old friends stopped communication with him.</p>

                <p>In 2077, Kerry contacts Henry for Samurai's reunion gig—and helps him break out of rehab—and tells him to meet up at Denny's villa. This led to Henry crashing a cement truck into Denny's backyard and filling her pool up with cement. This of course pisses Denny off, to the point where she refuses to do the reunion gig if Henry is there. So V, who accompanied Kerry there, is left with choosing either Henry or Denny.</p>

                <h1>Samurai's discography</h1>
                <p>Samurai released a total of six albums between 2003 and 2008 — with three being studio works, and the other three being concerts and jam sessions optioned by Universal. Only two of these albums are seen in the game, however, titled “Blistering Love”, and “Chippin' in”. A total of six actual songs were made for the game, which you can listen to below, and were performed by the real life band <a href="#Refused">Refused</a>.</p>

                <h1>Refused</h1>
                <p>As this is not technically about Refused, I won't be going into too much detail about them, but it would have been wrong to make this without mentioning them.</p>

                <p>Refused is a Swedish hardcore punk band originating from Sweden, formed in 1991. The band is composed of vocalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Lyxz%C3%A9n">Dennis Lyxzén</a>, guitarist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristofer_Steen">Kristofer Steen</a>, drummer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sandstr%C3%B6m">David Sandström</a>, and bassist Magnus Flagge. Guitarist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Br%C3%A4nnstr%C3%B6m">Jon Brännström</a> was a member from 1994, through reunions, until he was fired in late-2014.</p>

                <p>In 2019, it was announced that Refused would be partnering with <a href="#Cyberpunk2077">CD Projekt Red</a>, creating and recording original music for Cyberpunk 2077. The announcement was made alongside the release of <a href="#Songs">Chippin' In</a> on streaming services, the first single to be revealed for the project. Refused then went on the make the other five singles as well.</p>

                <h1>Cyberpunk 2077</h1>

                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing game, released in 2020, developed by Polish studio <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Projekt_Red">CD Projekt Red</a> and published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Projekt">CD Projekt</a>. The game is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pondsmith">Mike Pondsmith's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_(role-playing_game)">Cyberpunk</a> tabletop game series, with the plot set in the fictional metropolis of Night City, California, within the dystopian Cyberpunk universe. The player assumes the role of V (voiced by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4754308/">Gavin Drea</a> or <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0473873/">Cherami Leigh</a> depending on whether the player chooses the male or femal voice for V), a mercenary who gets reluctantly imbued with a cybernetic "bio-chip", or relic as it's referred to in the game, containing an engram of legendary rockstar and terrorist Johnny Silverhand. As Johnny's consciousness begins overwriting V's own, the two must work together to separate from each other and save V's life.</p>

                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 received praise from critics for its narrative, setting, and graphics. However, some of its gameplay elements received mixed responses while its themes and representation of transgender characters received some criticism. It was also widely criticized for bugs and glitches, particularly on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions. Sony removed it from the PlayStation Store from December 2020 to June 2021 while CD Projekt rectified some of the issues. CD Projekt became subject to investigations and class-action lawsuits for their perceived attempts at downplaying the severity of the technical problems before release; these were ultimately cleared with a settlement of US$1.85 million.</p>

                <p>Its total cost to develop and market (including updates and DLC) is reportedly between $436 million and $441 million, making it one of the most expensive video games to develop. By November 2024, the game had sold over 30 million units, making it one of the best-selling games of all time. A sequel, internally codenamed "Project Orion", was announced in 2022, and a DLC, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077:_Phantom_Liberty">Phantom Liberty</a>, was released in 2023. It was marketed together with and released in a similar time frame to update 2.0 for the base game, which significantly overhauled certain aspects of the game.</p>
